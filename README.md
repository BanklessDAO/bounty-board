# Bounty Board

This is a scrappy MVP mirroring the status of the BountyBoard project.

**BountyBoard** is an application that allows users to create and view bounties. They can also delete it or edit it anytime.

## Configuration (copied from next.js example README's)

### Step 1. Get the connection string of your MongoDB server

In the case of MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

For more details, follow this [MongoDB Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/drivers/) on how to connect to MongoDB.

### Step 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `MONGODB_URI` should be the MongoDB connection string you got from step 1.

### Step 3. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

## Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy this app to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

#### Deploy Your Local Project

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/import/git?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
